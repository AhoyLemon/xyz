I thought it was interesting to look at the toolkit that other people used, and thought I&apos;d provide my own. <i>But</i> sometimes the tools a person uses are more about something being the "good enough" option, so I thought I&apos;d get a little more specific: Those things marked with a <span class="yes"></span> are things which I think are great and totally recommend. Those things marked with a <span class="no"> </span> are things which I&apos;ve compromised into using for one way or another. It&apos;s the best I&apos;ve found, but you could talk me into something else.</p>'
