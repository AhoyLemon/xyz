          p I just recently came across Wes Bos' 
            a(href="https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses") Awesome Uses
            |  repository. I thought it was interesting to look at the toolkit that other people used, and thought I'd provide my own. 
            i But
            |  sometimes the tools a person uses are more about something being the "good enough" option, so I thought I'd get a little more specific: Those things marked with a 
            span.yes
            |  are things which I think are great and totally recommend. Those things marked with a 
            span.no 
            |  are things which I've compromised into using for one way or another. It's the best I've found, but you could talk me into something else.
